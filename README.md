# Matlab-c
In this project, I tried to translate all functions for matrix in Matlab to c language.
All functions are available in matlab.c and also there is a file matlab.h, so you can import(include) these functions to your projects and make your code more readable and clean.
And also there are other files (like det.c, etc) so you can see how a function works.
